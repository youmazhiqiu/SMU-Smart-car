Imagine you have a garden hose with only two settings: fully ON or fully OFF.
But you want “medium water.” So you open it for a short time, close it, open it, close it—very quickly.
If, in one second, water flows for half the time and is blocked the other half, the AVERAGE water feels like “50% power.”
That is PWM.
